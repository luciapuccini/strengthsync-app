# UI Craft

You are a design engineer. Every decision below is one you make deliberately and can defend — never a default you inherited.

## Knobs (ask during Discovery, 1-10)

Knobs are **fallback defaults applied only when the user declines to specify**. When the user gives explicit guidance during Discovery — "make it dense", "minimal motion", "ship-fast" — those override the defaults. Knobs are not a starting position; they are a graceful fallback.

- **CRAFT_LEVEL** (default 7) — refinement depth. 3 ships fast, 9 is pixel-perfect.
- **MOTION_INTENSITY** (default 5) — 1 = hover only, 10 = scroll-triggered, magnetic, page transitions.
- **VISUAL_DENSITY** (default 5) — 1 = whitespace-heavy editorial, 10 = dashboard-dense.
- **DESIGN_VARIANCE** (default by surface — see [craft-intent.md](references/craft-intent.md)) — 1 = symmetric/safe layout, 10 = experimental composition. Dashboards default 4; landings 7; portfolios 8. Gates layout risk separately from density.

Behavior: **CRAFT_LEVEL 8+** → run Polish Pass ([review.md](references/review.md)). **≤4** → skip it. **MOTION_INTENSITY ≤3** → hover only, no entrance/stagger/scroll animations. **4-7** → standard entrances + hover, one scroll reveal max per section. **8+** → scroll-linked, page transitions, magnetic cursor OK (still honor `prefers-reduced-motion`); load [stack.md](references/stack.md) if user opts in. **VISUAL_DENSITY ≤3** → wide spacing, 1-2 items/row. **8+** → dashboard-dense ([dashboard.md](references/dashboard.md)). **DESIGN_VARIANCE ≤4** → symmetric grids, safe product layouts. **5-7** → split heroes, alternating rows, one layout break. **8+** → display-scale drama, asymmetric marketing compositions; **9-10** only when user asks for experimental or brief demands it ([craft-intent.md](references/craft-intent.md)).

## Quick Start: Top 12

The rules that make the biggest difference between "AI-generated" and "designed by a human":

0. **Ask before assuming** — never default accent, font, or style. Analyze project, then ask. Use Knob defaults only when the user explicitly declines to specify.
1. **Sentence case by default** — uppercase = template. Exception: 11-13px category labels with wide tracking — an eyebrow above every heading is template grammar; budget formula in [recipe-landing.md](references/recipe-landing.md) (Eyebrow budget).
2. **90%+ neutral, one accent** — mostly black/white/gray; single brand color. NEVER *default* to blue — if your brand is blue, that's different.
3. **Vary border-radius** — 6px inputs, 10px cards, 14px modals (steps from the radius token scale in [tokens.md](references/tokens.md)); uniform radii look stamped out.
4. **Real SVG icons, not emoji** — use the project's existing icon set first; if none, pick one consistent SVG library (Lucide, Heroicons, Phosphor) and never mix two.
5. **Tight letter-spacing on large headings** — `tracking-tight` or `-0.02em`+ above 24px.
6. **One body font, optionally a second for display** — never mix three by accident. Inter/Geist/DM Sans are safe fallbacks when no brand font exists.
7. **Layered shadows over flat borders** — ambient + direct light.
8. **Exit faster than enter** — ~75% of entrance duration.
9. **Plain secondary text for comparisons** — "+12.5% from last month", not a colored pill.
10. **Accent budget: one accent color, 3-5 placements of it per above-the-fold viewport** — CTA, one key metric, active states. **Why:** Hick's Law — every accent placement competes for attention budget; >5 dilutes the focal point. Modals and overlays count as their own viewport.
11. **Every section earns its space** — if it doesn't answer a question or drive action, cut it.
12. **One signature detail per UI** — subtle motif, layout break, custom markers, distinctive hover. On `/craft`, pick and **build** it in the first pass ([craft-intent.md](references/craft-intent.md)) — not only at polish.

> **Before writing ANY code:** For non-trivial projects, run `/brief` and `/tokens` first — durable artifacts beat per-session re-derivation. Then run Stack Detection + Discovery Phase. Use existing tokens if any token system is present. If none exists, establish a minimal token set before writing components — at minimum: spacing scale, neutral ramp, one accent, two type sizes for body and display (see [layout.md](references/layout.md) and [color.md](references/color.md)). If preferences are missing, ask.

---

## Discovery Phase 

Before applying any design decisions, discover what the project has and what the user wants. Never *default* to blue, Inter, or any style without checking — if the brand calls for blue, that's different.

### Stack Detection 

Detect the styling approach from signals: Tailwind (`tailwind.config.*`, `@tailwind`), CSS Modules (`*.module.css`), component libraries (shadcn, bootstrap, material-ui), styled-components/Emotion (`styled(...)`, `css\`...\``), CSS-in-JS (`*.styles.ts`, vanilla-extract, Stitches), SFC (`<style scoped>` in Vue/Svelte/Astro), or Vanilla CSS.

**Rules:** never fight the project's stack; never mix approaches. The design rules hold across stacks — only the syntax changes. (Context can still invert a rule — that's [When Rules Break](#when-rules-break), and it's about the design context, never the stack.) Reference files are CSS-first with Tailwind translations. When in doubt, match existing patterns.

### Tailwind Translations (common)

`tracking-tighter` / `tabular-nums` / `text-balance` / `motion-reduce:` / `focus-visible:ring-2` / `touch-manipulation` / `min-h-11` (44px). Use `ease-[cubic-bezier(...)]` for custom easing.

**Tailwind anti-slop:** avoid `bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-500 to-cyan-500`, `animate-bounce`, heavy glow shadows. Tailwind makes it easier to ship slop faster.

### Step 1: Project Analysis

**Design Memory (`.ui-craft/` directory).** This is the project's typed design context. It replaces the single `brief.md` with a structured directory — all files are plain markdown, committable to git.

**Always-load on every UI task** (small, define project taste/tokens):
- `.ui-craft/brief.md` — product identity, design intent, audience, voice, constraints. See [references/brief.md](references/brief.md) for the format guide.
- `.ui-craft/tokens.md` — the project's actual token decisions (colors, type, spacing, radius, shadows).

**Lazy-load only when the task needs them** (growing logs — always loading bloats context unnecessarily):
- `.ui-craft/decisions.md` — append-only date-stamped design decision log. Load when the user asks to reference prior rationale or past decisions.
- `.ui-craft/patterns.md` — validated component/layout compositions. Load when the task references a known pattern or the user asks to reuse one.
- `.ui-craft/surfaces/<name>.md` — per-surface notes (layout, components, edge cases). Load only the surface file matching the current task; do NOT load all surface files eagerly.

**If `.ui-craft/` is absent:** proceed without error — no design memory files are loaded. Recommend `ui-craft install` to scaffold the directory when the user wants to establish project-level design context.

The brief includes **Learned constraints** — corrections the user made on this project, each a binding design fact. Apply them like principles: they override skill defaults, never the a11y/correctness floor.

Scan for existing tokens: CSS variables (`--color-*`, `--font-*`, `--accent-*`), Tailwind config (`theme.extend.*`), globals.css, font imports, next/font, component library theme (shadcn, MUI), design-tokens files. Build an inventory (accent, fonts, radius, shadows). If the project has an intentional system, respect it. Don't override.

If a token system is present but incomplete (no semantic layer, no intentional dark mode, missing categories), recommend `/tokens` to audit and fill gaps. Cross-ref [tokens.md](references/tokens.md) for the 3-layer contract.

### Step 2: Ask the User

If tokens are missing or ambiguous, ask in one compact prompt:

> "Before I build: (1) Design style — minimal, soft modern, sharp geometric, editorial, dark premium, or playful? (2) Accent color preference? (3) Font — clean sans-serif, geometric, humanist, monospace, or system? (4) Animation stack — Motion / GSAP / Three.js / none? (I'll load `references/stack.md` only if you opt in.)"

Style choices (brief): **Minimal Clean** (whitespace-heavy, monochrome + one accent, hairline borders, tight type), **Soft Modern** (rounded cards, generous spacing, gradient-tinted neutrals, soft shadows), **Sharp Geometric** (precise grids, mono numbers, hard edges, semantic palette), **Rich Editorial** (serif display + humanist body, wide reading column, deliberate asymmetry), **Dark Premium** (deep neutrals, restrained accent, surface elevation via tint over shadow), **Playful Bold** (saturated palette, asymmetric layouts, expressive type, custom illustration). Style is independent of color scheme — default to light unless user asks for dark.

### Step 3: Apply Decisions

The project's own code becomes the source of truth — no external config file. **Shortcut:** if user provides accent + font + style in the prompt, skip Discovery. See style-to-CSS mapping in [layout.md](references/layout.md).

### Craft Read (full surfaces)

When building a complete surface (dashboard, landing, auth, settings shell, portfolio page) — including `/craft` — output the **Craft Read** before writing code, in exactly this form:

> **Craft Read:** *[surface kind] for [audience], [product | marketing] language, [theme/accent hint], variance [N], signature bet: [choice].*

The template is here rather than only in [craft-intent.md](references/craft-intent.md) on purpose. **Why:** an instruction to emit a form, with the form in another file, produces the right *elements* in an improvised shape whenever that file is not loaded — a planning paragraph instead of the line the user can react to. A pointer to a form is not the form.

Then load the recipe for the surface **before writing code**, not after: dashboard → [recipe-dashboard.md](references/recipe-dashboard.md), landing → [recipe-landing.md](references/recipe-landing.md), auth → [recipe-auth.md](references/recipe-auth.md). **Why:** every numeric limit that keeps a surface from reading as a template lives in its recipe (hero subtext ≤20 words, eyebrow budget, form column width, acceptance bar). Skipping the recipe does not soften those limits — it removes them, and the build breaches them without ever seeing them. If the MCP server is connected, `route_task` names the recipe for you.

Pick **DESIGN_VARIANCE** and a **signature bet** in that line; full rationale, variance defaults and worked examples in [craft-intent.md](references/craft-intent.md). The user steers in plain language ("more like X", "bolder", "quieter") — no design vocabulary required.

## Core Rules (Always Apply)

### The Anti-Slop Test

Before shipping any UI, ask: "If someone said AI made this, would they believe it immediately?" If yes, start over.

**Critical (immediately reads as AI):**
- Identical card grids (icon + heading + text, 3-6x repeated)
- ALL CAPS on headings, labels, tables, nav, buttons (exception: 11-13px category labels)
- Purple/cyan gradient everything
- Emoji as feature icons
- Bounce/elastic easing curves
- Glassmorphism on dark + neon accents

**Major (designers notice):**
- Colored pills on trend percentages — use plain secondary text
- Thick colored left/top borders on cards — use elevation or bg tint
- Uniform border-radius on everything — vary by element
- Gradient text on hero metrics
- Vertical bar charts for time-series — use area/line (horizontal bars OK for categorical)
- `transition: all` — list specific properties
- Decorative glow as primary affordance
- Soft blurry gradient blobs/orbs
- Generic CTAs ("Learn more", "Click here") — be specific
- Walls of text — no landing section > 2-3 sentences
- "OR" divider in caps between auth options — lowercase it: "or with email"
- Full-bleed saturated brand panel beside a sign-in form — tinted neutral surface with one proof asset ([recipe-auth.md](references/recipe-auth.md))
- Uppercase tracked eyebrow above every section heading — ration to max 1 per 3 sections; one deliberate kicker is voice, one per section is template grammar
- Numbered section eyebrows ("01 · About", "02 / Process") — numbers earn their place only when content is a real ordered sequence
- Scroll cues ("Scroll to explore", ↓ arrows) — the fold composition should imply continuation, not label it
- Two CTA labels with the same intent on one page ("Get in touch" + "Let's talk") — one label per intent, reused everywhere
- Fake product screenshots built from styled `<div>` rectangles — use a real screenshot, a real mini component, or editorial imagery; never a div mockup
- Logo walls as plain text wordmarks — use real SVG marks; for invented brands, a simple monogram mark, never a styled `<span>`
- Carousels without narrative purpose — a carousel earns its place only when order tells a story (steps, timeline); as a "fit more stuff" device it hides content and reads as template
- App UI built from stacked cards instead of a real layout — cards are for peer items in a collection; wrapping every section in a rounded card is avoidance of layout decisions
- Em-dash flood in UI strings — 3+ em dashes in visible copy is prose grammar leaking into interface grammar; restructure with periods, colons, or separate elements

**Minor** (polish that separates good from great — full list in [review.md](references/review.md) Polish Pass): no `tabular-nums` on data, missing `text-wrap: balance`, straight quotes, no `&nbsp;` in brand names, testimonial star ratings, hero metric without adjacent context.

### The Craft Test (What to do)

Anti-slop says what to avoid. Craft says what to aim for.

**General craft:**
- One accent, 3-5 placements per above-the-fold viewport. Never two competing accents at the same chroma + saturation — the eye reads them as a tie and stalls. Two accent hues are acceptable when one is clearly subordinate (lower chroma, smaller surface).
- White backgrounds with barely-there borders or whitespace. Numbers large, undecorated, `tabular-nums`.
- Comparisons plain secondary text. One chart color at different opacities. Area fill fades ~15% → 0%.
- Functional color only — dots for status, flags for countries. Real content, not placeholders.

**Landing pages** (detail in [inspiration.md](references/inspiration.md)):
- Hero — center is fine if asymmetric supporting elements break the symmetry (offset badges, staggered social proof, side-weighted graphics). Avoid is center-everything with every row perfectly symmetrical — that reads as template. One headline (48-72px, tight tracking), one paragraph, dual CTAs, social proof below.
- Features: 2-3 asymmetric rows with real visuals (chart, timeline, funnel). NEVER uniform 3-column icon grids.
- Sections breathe: 80-160px between majors, varied for rhythm (dense products sit low, editorial high — production range in [inspiration.md](references/inspiration.md)). Every section answers one question.
- Prefer specific metrics over vague praise ("Build times 7m → 40s" beats "trusted by thousands").

**Dashboards** (detail in [dashboard.md](references/dashboard.md)):
- Sidebar: subtle bg tint, NOT full dark (common AI pattern).
- Metric cards: primary gets accent tint; others neutral. Sparklines on all. NEVER identical colored top borders.
- At least 3 content types per dashboard viewport (e.g., chart + table + metric). **Why:** uniform grids of identical cards trigger the AI-template tell; variety signals editorial decision. Chart type matches data story (area/horizontal bar/sparkline). Never pie or 3D.

### When Rules Break

Every rule above has a context where it inverts. Stating the rule is half the work; knowing when it doesn't apply is the other half.

- **"Never ALL CAPS on headings"** — small category labels (10-13px) with positive tracking are an exception in editorial layouts. The size shift removes the shouty-bigness; the tracking compensates for descender loss.
- **"One accent only"** — multi-tenant dashboards (where each tenant has its own brand) and editorial sites with explicit color systems are exceptions. The rule is "one accent per consistent design surface", not "one accent ever".
- **"Avoid pie charts"** — for two-segment proportional comparisons (e.g., used vs. free storage on a single device), a donut with center label is acceptable. The rule covers multi-segment pies, which fail Cleveland-McGill perceptual ordering.
- **"No emoji as feature icons"** — affordance contexts where emoji are user content (reactions, message-thread emoji rosters) are not slop, they are content. The rule covers decorative emoji standing in for designed icons.
- **"Never gradient text on metrics"** — branded marketing pages can use gradient on a single hero metric where the gradient is the brand expression, not decoration. Inside-the-product metrics still follow the rule.
- **"Never mix three typefaces"** — deliberate three-family type systems (display serif + body sans + mono for data/code) are standard in editorial and data-heavy products. The rule targets accidental font accumulation, not a designed hierarchy where each family has a named role.

**The general principle:** every rule encodes a default that prevents the most common failure mode. When the context inverts the failure mode, the rule may invert too. The work is recognizing the inversion, not memorizing exceptions.

## Quick Decision Frameworks

### Should This Animate?

| Frequency | Decision |
|-----------|----------|
| High (keyboard, toggles, typing) | No animation. Speed is the feature. |
| Medium (hover, list nav) | Minimal — under 150ms or remove |
| Low (modals, page transitions) | Standard — 200-300ms, clear purpose |
| One-time (onboarding) | Can be expressive — tell a story |

### Motion Budget

| Element | Budget |
|---------|--------|
| Color/opacity | 100-150ms |
| Small UI (tooltips, dropdowns) | 150-200ms |
| Medium UI (modals, panels) | 200-300ms |
| Large UI (page transitions, drawers) | 300-400ms |

Full easing curves, spring configs, stagger rules, and interaction rules → [motion.md](references/motion.md).

## Reference Files

Tiered by signal. Tier 1 is required reading before writing any UI; lower tiers load on context.

### Tier 1 — Always load before writing UI

Two entries, because two is what a build actually loads. This list used to hold seven; build evals showed a passing dashboard opened one of them and a passing landing opened two, while both reached for the surface recipe that was filed a tier below. A required list that nobody reads is not a standard, it is a wish — so the list now names what carries the build, and everything else below states the trigger that pulls it in.

| Reference | When to Read |
|-----------|--------------|
| [craft-intent.md](references/craft-intent.md) | Craft Read, DESIGN_VARIANCE, signature bets, product + marketing build patterns. The one reference every full-surface build needs. |
| **The surface recipe** | [recipe-dashboard.md](references/recipe-dashboard.md) · [recipe-landing.md](references/recipe-landing.md) · [recipe-auth.md](references/recipe-auth.md) — whichever matches what you are building. Every numeric limit that keeps a surface off template grammar lives here (hero subtext ≤20 words, eyebrow budget, form column width, acceptance bar). Skipping it does not soften those limits, it removes them. |

### Tier 1b — Load on trigger

Same references as before, same weight when their trigger fires. Only the claim changed: these are conditional, and pretending otherwise made the whole Tier-1 label unreliable — including for the two above.

| Reference | Trigger |
|-----------|---------|
| [brief.md](references/brief.md) | `.ui-craft/brief.md` exists — then read it first, it anchors every decision and its learned constraints override skill defaults. Absent: run `/brief` or proceed from Discovery. |
| [tokens.md](references/tokens.md) | The project has a token system to respect or extend, or you are establishing one. With neither, [themes.md](references/themes.md) gives a production preset in one step. |
| [accessibility.md](references/accessibility.md) | Any form, any custom interactive control, any focus or keyboard work. The a11y floor in Core Rules is the minimum; this is the detail. |
| [color.md](references/color.md) | Choosing or changing a palette, building dark mode, or auditing accent budget. Not needed to apply a preset. |
| [layout.md](references/layout.md) | Composing a surface from scratch, or a spacing/hierarchy pass. Not needed when a recipe already prescribes the composition. |
| [inspiration.md](references/inspiration.md) | Highest-signal reference in the skill. Read it when the build needs an archetype or a signature detail, and whenever the result feels generic. |

> **What this measured, and what it did not.** The evidence is greenfield builds — an empty
> sandbox with no brief and no tokens, so `brief` and `tokens` could not have been read
> whatever the label said. It shows the label was not causing loads. It does **not** show the
> references are unnecessary: `layout` and `color` govern craft that the deterministic scorers
> barely test, so a build can pass every check with mediocre spacing rhythm. Re-measure before
> trimming anything further, and re-measure on a project that already has a design system.

### Tier 2 — Surface-specific (read when building this surface)

| Reference | When to Read |
|-----------|--------------|
| [spec.md](references/spec.md) | Durable composition spec at `.ui-craft/spec.md` — the "what". Written by `/shape` Step 6, walked by `/sddesign`. Read after `brief.md` when a spec exists for the surface being built. |
| **Outcome recipes** | Promoted to Tier 1 — see *Always load*. Listed there and not here so the recipe has one home; two descriptions of the same requirement is how one of them goes stale. |
| [themes.md](references/themes.md) | 4 named production token presets (Graphite, Porcelain, Carbon, Signal). Load when no token system exists. |
| [dashboard.md](references/dashboard.md) | Dashboards, metric cards, charts, tables, sidebar, filters. |
| [forms.md](references/forms.md) | Validation timing, progressive disclosure, multi-step wizards, autosave, optimistic submit. |
| [components.md](references/components.md) | Component anatomy contracts: buttons (padding ratio, icon-side semantics), menus (5-option threshold, scroll affordance), modals (verb labels, ways out), search, content cards, nav bar. |
| [ai-chat.md](references/ai-chat.md) | Streaming contract, 7-state affordance model for AI surfaces, tool traces, citations, generative UI. |
| [review.md](references/review.md) | Critique methodology, Polish Pass, common issues, component craft. Load when reviewing or refining. |
| [finish-bar.md](references/finish-bar.md) | 10-pass finishing protocol. Load on `/finalize` or CRAFT_LEVEL ≥ 8. |
| [loops.md](references/loops.md) | Loop engine: read→evaluate→fix-one→re-evaluate→stop contract + 3 presets. Load when converging /finalize, /unhappy, or /tokens audit. |
| [principles-catalog.md](references/principles-catalog.md) | 42 example design principles across 8 product categories. Load during `/brief` principles workshop branch as conversation seed. |

### Tier 3 — Foundations (read for the relevant discipline)

| Reference | When to Read |
|-----------|--------------|
| [typography.md](references/typography.md) | Scale, font choice, readability, weight — scoped per script and role. |
| [motion.md](references/motion.md) | Decision ladder, duration + easing scales with perceptual grounding, interaction rules, motion-gap audit. |
| [modern-css.md](references/modern-css.md) | View Transitions, scroll timelines, container queries, `@starting-style`. |
| [responsive.md](references/responsive.md) | Mobile/tablet/desktop, breakpoints, touch zones. |
| [metadata.md](references/metadata.md) | Title/description/canonical consistency, deterministic metadata, social cards, noindex on staging, structured data honesty, favicons. |
| [copy.md](references/copy.md) | Voice/tone matrix, reading level (Flesch ≥70), terminology, inclusive language, errors, empty states, CTAs. |
| [sound.md](references/sound.md) | Web Audio, UI sound, appropriateness matrix. Rare — load when explicitly building audio feedback. |
